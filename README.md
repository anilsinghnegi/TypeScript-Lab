# learning-typescript-journey

A hands-on journey into learning **TypeScript**â€”from essentials to advanced concepts. This repository documents practical code samples, mini-projects, and key lessons as I build my TypeScript foundation.

## About

This project is dedicated to exploring:
- Type system fundamentals: types, interfaces, enums, generics
- Functions, classes, and inheritance
- Working with modules and namespaces
- Integrating TypeScript in web and Node.js projects
- Refactoring JavaScript to TypeScript

## Getting Started

Clone the repository: https://github.com/anilsinghnegi/TypeScript-Lab.git


Install dependencies (if any project uses npm/yarn):


## Structure

- `/basics`: Core concepts and type exercises
- `/advanced`: Advanced topics and patterns
- `/projects`: Mini TypeScript projects and real-world demos

## Resources

- [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/)
- [Beginner's Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-typescript-beginners-guide/)

## Goals

- Strengthen real-world TypeScript coding ability
- Document progress with clear, runnable examples
- Build a reusable knowledge base for future reference
